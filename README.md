**Description ****
                 Title: Restaurant Recommendation System Using Classification Algorithms

Objective:
The goal of this machine learning model is to recommend restaurants to users by predicting their preferences based on key features such as cuisine type, price rating, location, and user behavior. This is framed as a classification problem, where the model classifies restaurants into recommendation categories for a user (e.g., "Highly Recommended", "Recommended", "Not Recommended").

Key Features (Inputs):
Cuisine Preference – e.g., Indian, Italian, Chinese, etc.

Price Rating – Numerical or categorical value (e.g., 1–5 or "Low", "Medium", "High").

User Rating History – Past ratings given by the user to restaurants.

Distance from User – How far the restaurant is from the user's location.

Restaurant Popularity – Based on average ratings or number of reviews.

Meal Type Preference – Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner.

Ambience or Setting – Casual, Romantic, Family, etc. (optional based on data availability).

Model Type: Classification
Problem Framing: Multi-class classification (e.g., classifying restaurants into recommendation levels).

Label (Target Variable): Recommendation Category (e.g., 0 = Not Recommended, 1 = Recommended, 2 = Highly Recommended).

Algorithm Choice:
The model can be trained using various classification algorithms. Depending on dataset size and performance, some ideal algorithms include:

Random Forest Classifier – Great for handling mixed data types and non-linear decision boundaries.

Logistic Regression – Useful as a baseline model.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) – Effective in high-dimensional spaces.

XGBoost or LightGBM – Highly efficient for structured data and often delivers top performance.

Neural Networks – When the dataset is large and contains complex patterns.

For a “perfect” classification algorithm, ensemble models like Random Forest or XGBoost are often best-performing in structured recommendation systems.

Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

ROC-AUC Curve (if binary classification is used)

Use Case Example:
A user who prefers "Italian cuisine", "medium price", and has previously rated "family-friendly" restaurants highly will be recommended restaurants that match this profile and classified as "Highly Recommended".
